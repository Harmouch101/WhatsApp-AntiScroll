# WhatsApp-Anti-Scroll
 This Google Chrome Extension simply prevents WhatsApp Web Version from scrolling all the way to the top when you reply to a message from the bottom.

 It can be very useful for companies who are using WhatsApp Business to stay in touch with customer, or individuals who get a lot of messages.

 With this extension, when you reply to an older message from the bottom, you won't have to scroll all the way back to the bottom to reply to the next chat, the extension will do it automatically for you ðŸ˜Š

 It's a very simple extension, yet very useful, this problem has bothered me for years, since I own a company and WhatsApp is the main method of communication with my customers.

# Installation
**1.** Download the whole project from GitHub and extract it

**2.** Enter `chrome://extensions` on the address bar

**3.** Enable `Developer mode` if it's not enabled already.

**4.** Click on `Load unpacked`, on the top left side of the extensions page.

That's it, make sure you close the WhatsApp Web page and open it again, now it shouldn't auto scroll to the top when you reply to a message :)
